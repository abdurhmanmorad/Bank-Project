How It Works
All client data is stored in ClientFile.txt.

Each client has an account number, PIN code, name, phone, and balance.
Usage
Compile the code using a C++14 compatible compiler:
Run the program:
Follow the on-screen menu to manage clients and perform transactions.
File Structure
Bank v2 (Extension).cpp - Main source code file.
ClientFile.txt - Data file for storing client information.
Notes
Make sure ClientFile.txt is in the same directory as the executable.
The program uses simple text-based storage; no database is required.
All operations are performed via the console.
